**Project Overview**: This project focused on Monqabad Village in Asyut Governorate, a large village with the potential for future development into a city. The primary objective was to conduct a spatial suitability analysis to identify the most appropriate locations for establishing schools and hospitals within the village. The project involved creating maps to illustrate the optimal sites for these facilities.

**Tools and Techniques**:





ArcGIS: Used for spatial analysis and map creation.



Google Earth: Utilized for capturing georeferenced images.



ERDAS IMAGINE: Employed for processing satellite imagery.

**Project Goals**:





Heat Maps: Generated to identify areas with high population density and potential demand for schools and hospitals.



NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index) Maps: Created to assess water bodies and their proximity to potential sites.



NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) Maps: Developed to evaluate vegetation cover and its suitability for construction.



NDBI (Normalized Difference Built-up Index) Maps: Produced to analyze built-up areas and their impact on site selection.

**Outcome**: The project successfully produced comprehensive maps that highlight the most suitable locations for establishing schools and hospitals in Monqabad Village. These maps provide valuable insights for future urban planning and development in the region.
